# Appearance

It is important that we can move undetected among the Earthlings. Our cultural experts have assembled a generic set of clothing to mimic the Earthling appearance.

**Note** Do not remove your clothing without first refering to the Earthling FAQ.

Please visit the replicator and request the following attire:

- Jeans
- T-shirt
- Hoodie
- Sneakers
- Ball-cap

If you will be on planet November to March, add:

- Boots
- Coat
- Mittens
- Scarf
- Toque

> **IMPORTANT**
> Antenna must be concealed at all times!

> NEVER remove your ball-cap/toque
> 
> If a human requests that you remove your hat you can avoid compliance by saying: *Dude, I am having a bad hair day!*
